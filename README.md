Uniflow Themes for Pegasus

It's verry much a mod of the nxe theme my goal was to get Pegasus to match up with the uniflow themes and center the box art and move the text to be centered with out modification but I'm not quite there yet as  i had to make a slight adjustment to the wallpaper but i just stretched it to fit for now
